# speedtest.php
Speedtest.net mini/legacy-http light server. Works with [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)

In mid-2017, speedtest.net (Ookla) decided to shut down their speedtest mini project. 

This repo is an attempt at creating our own speedtest-mini server, and use [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) with it.

TBD:
A functioning GUI - can be something like https://github.com/adolfintel/speedtest
